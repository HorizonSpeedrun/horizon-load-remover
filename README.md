# Horizon Load Remover

This repository provides a OBS-centric approach to video-based load removal for console speedruns for Horizon Zero Dawn and its Remastered version.


The up-to-date rules for Horizon Zero Dawn for the loads that count can be found [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hzd/guides/6atmp).

## Autosplitter (PC)

The autosplitters for the Horizon games on PC have been moved to a separate repository: [Autosplitters](https://github.com/HorizonSpeedrun/HorizonAutosplitters)

## Video-based Load Remover (Console)

Based on previous work on the load remover by [Blegas78](https://github.com/blegas78/autoSplitters) and the [description in the SceneSwitcher wiki](https://github.com/WarmUpTill/SceneSwitcher/wiki/Activate-overlay-to-hide-parts-of-the-screen).

Please see [the dedicated README for its setup](video-based-LR.md)
